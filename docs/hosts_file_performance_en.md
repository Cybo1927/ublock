Regarding the impact on system performance of a large hosts file.

On the Internet there are some opinions that with a large hosts file the system can slow down. I wanted to cite several links, but after several hours of googling I could not find a single quality source. But:

- Android: I’ve been using huge hosts files since 2012, and I’m not aware of any performance issues on any available device — and they were then small and weak. Theoretically, some effect may be present, but practically the acceleration from blocking advertising and other parasitic requests far outweighs this effect, even if it exists.

- Windows: On Windows 7 (and older) in some cases, indeed, there may be slowdowns. On Windows 10, Microsoft finally made a change, and this problem is already irrelevant. For details, see the author of the hosts file with a 20-year (!) History: http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm

It is worth noting that Windows 7 has already been withdrawn from support and does not receive updates. If you are using this version, or even older, you can try to disable the DNS Client service (see the link above for details). But it is better to go to the current version.
