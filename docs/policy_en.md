<details>
    <summary>
        Ads, banners, popup windows
    </summary>
    Yes, advertising is the engine of commerce, but it is often very intrusive.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Animated elements. Including unrequested slide animation
    </summary>
    Please, do not flicker. Start the video, animation and gifs only by clicking on them.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Large logos, large heads with pictures, fancy logos
    </summary>
    Can we start reading and not scrolling through the half-screen head? And yet, tell someone to the designers and their customers that the overwhelming number of all these fancy logos and slogans are no good at all. Sorry.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Large and/or animated avatars on the forums
    </summary>
    Attract a disproportionate amount of attention.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Signatures on the forums
    </summary>
    With the tenth reading of the same profound phrase the reader will not be happier.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Fixed elements, that don't move when scrolling a page
    </summary>
    When all text smoothly goes up, and some button remains nailed down, it looks terrible.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Moving text stripes (marquee)
    </summary>
    Designer needed more space on the screen? Or is it the echoes of old stock reports?
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Buttons like "To the top"
    </summary>
    Taking up space and often fixed
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Warnings about cookies and GDPR
    </summary>    
    We understand that you want to meet the requirements of European regulators, but these windows do not carry useful information.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Warnings about age
    </summary>
    Is that requirements or stupidity of web designers? But it looks pretty ridiculous.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Offers to register
    </summary>
    Button/link in the menu is enough.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Survey or feedback forms
    </summary>
    "Your feedback is very important to us*"? 
    <br> *In fact, quite rare.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Suggestions for sending typos
    </summary>
    Misprints do not usually happen, and this warning constantly irritates the eyes.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        In online stores: blocks of viewed products
    </summary>
    We do not suffer from memory loss. And, perhaps, this time we came to look at completely different products than last time.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        In blogs: expanded blocks "about the author", self-promotion
    </summary>
    Button/link in the menu is enough. It is not necessary to push the reader your portrait on each page.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        In online stores: payment methods
    </summary>
    Most often with icons of payment systems. This is such a rare event - online payment by credit card!
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        In online stores: brand listings
    </summary>
    All in a row, yes. Terribly helpful.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Fixed top, bottom, side buttons
    </summary>
    Usually this is done by online shops. Search engines are allowed to fix the string, the rest, sorry, no. There is not much space on the screen.
</details>

    Saying modestly, this list is the most comprehensive solution avalable at the moment to get rid of all these jumping buttons with handsets.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Sites, mimicking to the well-known services, 
    </summary>
    То есть, делающие вид, что вы зашли на ВКонтакте, например, и предлагающие вам ввести пароль. Мошенники, в общем. И эти сайтики плодятся, как грибы после дождя. На самом деле, лучшая защита от мошенников - здравый смысл.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        Микрофинансовые организации, онлайн-казино
    </summary>
    На самом деле, заблокировать какое-нибудь Азино777 не получается даже у государства со всеми его ресурсами. Но попробовать-то можно.
